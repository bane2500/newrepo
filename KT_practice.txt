This first block means the current branch is the main one, not on some sub 
branch like dev, so all files are updated on the same branch

The file KT_status.txt was recently modified, but the git add command has not
been used, so they're not staged for commiting this updated version in order to
push these changes, must first add, then commit, and push

The file KT_noadd.txt is the only file that has not previously been added so 
git is not tracking its changes as there is no copy on the remote repo

Basically says since the last push, the changes made on local repo have not 
been added to the staging area and there is nothing to commit

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
# means the current branch is the main one, not on some sub branch like dev, 
# so all files are updated on the same branch

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   KT_status.txt

# the file KT_status.txt was recently modified, but the git add command has not
# been used, so they're not staged for commiting this updated version
# in order to push these changes, must first add, then commit, and push 

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	KT_noadd.txt

# the file KT_noadd.txt is the only file that has not previously been added 
# so git is not tracking its changes as there is no copy on the remote repo

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
# basically says since the last push, the changes made on local repo have not 
# been added to the staging area and there is nothing to commit

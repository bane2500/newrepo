I have used git for a couple of classes previously, both for assignment/project
submission and for retrieving lecture material. It has been really helpful with
groupwork for coding projects, allowing for task management, version control, 
and general organization. For one class we had to use GitLab instead of GitHub,
mainly for its easy CI/CD build. 
Most hurdles that came up for me all involved not using the most updated 
repo and thus created conflicts with new commits, but those were resolved quite
easily. In the future, I hope to be more familiar with the general git work flowto be able to work more efficiently with others on collaborative projects.
